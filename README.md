## Ebay List App

The was a small single page application I built using: React, React DnD, React Bootstrap, The Ebay API. For the backend it communicates with my own API built with Ruby on Rails ([Link](https://github.com/DylPickle96/Ebay-List-App-Backend)). The project starts its self by fetching 10 pseudo random listing from the Ebay API. You can update the list Searching by key term, choosing an option in the sort dropdown menu, select something from the category dropdown menu, or drag and drop items in the list manually (Implemented using React DnD). You can also press a button to recall the Ebay API to get yourself a fresh list!
